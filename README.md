# Advent of Code 2023

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) is a collection of programming puzzles, with two parts being released each day of the advent.
They can be completed in any programming language.

This repository collects my solutions for the 2023 puzzles, implemented in Rust.

## Usage

First, make sure to [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).
Then, clone the repository and add an `inputs/day_XX.txt` file containing the puzzle input. It is discouraged to publish the puzzle inputs, so they are ignored by git.
Finally, use `cargo run --bin day_XX` to solve the puzzle.

To benchmark the performance of the implementation, use `cargo run --bin day_XX -- --bench`.
To run only one of the puzzle parts, use e.g. `cargo run --bin day_XX -- --part_2`.
